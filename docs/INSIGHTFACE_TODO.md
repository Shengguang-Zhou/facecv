# InsightFace Integration TODO

Based on comprehensive research of InsightFace and InsightFace-REST repositories, this document outlines the integration plan for upgrading our current basic implementation to production-ready face recognition.

## Current Status
- ✅ Basic face detection using Haar cascades (COMPLETED - replaced with SCRFD)
- ✅ Simple pixel-based embeddings (COMPLETED - replaced with ArcFace)
- ✅ SQLite database integration
- ✅ API endpoints for registration, recognition, verification
- ✅ Camera streaming support
- ✅ InsightFace Python package installed
- ✅ Real InsightFace models integrated and tested

## Integration Plan

### Phase 1: Core Model Integration (High Priority) ✅ COMPLETED

#### 1.1 Model Zoo Manager
- ✅ Create model zoo manager for automatic downloads
- ✅ Implement model caching and version management
- ✅ Add integrity checks (MD5 hashes)
- ✅ Support Buffalo_l model pack (recommended default)

#### 1.2 Real Detection Pipeline
- ✅ Replace Haar cascades with SCRFD detection models
- ✅ Implement face alignment preprocessing
- ✅ Add 5-point facial landmark detection
- ✅ Support configurable detection thresholds
- ✅ Add face quality assessment

#### 1.3 ArcFace Recognition
- ✅ Implement real ArcFace embedding extraction
- ✅ Replace pixel-based embeddings with 512-dim ArcFace
- ✅ Update similarity calculations to use cosine similarity
- ✅ Improve recognition accuracy significantly

### Phase 2: Enhanced Analysis Features (Medium Priority)

#### 2.1 Face Attribute Analysis
- ✅ Age estimation integration (COMPLETED - integrated with buffalo_l)
- ✅ Gender classification (COMPLETED - integrated with buffalo_l)
- ✅ Emotion recognition (COMPLETED - 7 emotions with FER+ model)
- ✅ Face mask detection (COMPLETED - rule-based color detection)
- ✅ Quality scoring improvements (COMPLETED)

#### 2.2 Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Batch inference support (COMPLETED - batch processing APIs)
- ✅ GPU acceleration (if available) (COMPLETED - ONNX GPU providers)
- ✅ Memory-efficient processing (COMPLETED - optimized inference)
- ✅ Asynchronous model loading (COMPLETED - lazy loading)

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Low Priority)

#### 3.1 Multi-Model Support
- [ ] Support multiple detection models (SCRFD variants)
- [ ] Support multiple recognition models
- [ ] Dynamic model switching
- [ ] TensorRT acceleration support

#### 3.2 Enhanced APIs
- ✅ Add face analysis endpoints (COMPLETED - emotion, mask, attributes)
- ✅ Batch processing APIs (COMPLETED - 5 batch endpoints)
- [ ] Model management APIs
- [ ] Performance monitoring endpoints

### Key InsightFace Components to Integrate

#### FaceAnalysis Class Usage
```python
from insightface.app import FaceAnalysis

app = FaceAnalysis(providers=['CPUExecutionProvider'])
app.prepare(ctx_id=0, det_size=(640, 640))
faces = app.get(image)
```

#### Model Zoo Integration
```python
import insightface
from insightface.model_zoo import get_model

det_model = get_model('scrfd_10g_bnkps.onnx')
rec_model = get_model('arcface_r100_v1.onnx')
```

### Expected Performance Improvements
- **Detection Accuracy**: Haar cascades (~70%) → SCRFD (~90%+)
- **Recognition Accuracy**: Pixel embeddings (~30%) → ArcFace (~99%+)
- **Processing Speed**: Optimized ONNX inference
- **Feature Richness**: Age, gender, emotion, quality scores
